# Homework 1: Debugging Swift in Xcode

## Due
Thursday, February 4 at 11:59 PM

## Description
In Homework 1, you will be debugging Swift code inside a Playground. Xcode
Playgrounds are a great place to test out the effects of certain lines of code
and to just play around without having to create entire new projects. They also
give very useful information that can make debugging easy. Let the compiler be
your guide. Be mindful of its suggestions, warnings, and errors.

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain
        YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. Add an upstream remote that points to our original repository.
4. **Debug debugging.playground.**
5. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository.
